# Bits&Bytes Kolkata

Official platform for Bits&Bytes Kolkata, a teen-led coding community based in Kolkata, India. This repository powers the public website and community pages.

## What This Project Includes

- Next.js App Router website for community pages, events, join, and contact.
- Supabase-backed forms.
- Production-oriented frontend with 3D/interactive UI components.

## Tech Stack

- Framework: Next.js 16, React 19, TypeScript 5
- Styling/UI: Tailwind CSS 4, Radix UI, custom animated components
- Data: Supabase (PostgreSQL)
- AI: OpenAI SDK against Hack Club proxy endpoints
- Deployment: Vercel
- Package manager: pnpm

## Getting Started

### 1. Prerequisites

- Node.js 20+
- pnpm 9+
- A Supabase project
- A Hack Club proxy API key for AI endpoints

### 2. Install Dependencies

```bash
pnpm install
```

### 3. Configure Environment Variables

Copy `.env.example` to `.env.local` and fill in values.

Required in practice (based on current code paths):

```env
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL=...
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=...
HACKCLUB_PROXY_API_KEY=...
GOOGLE_SITE_VERIFICATION=...
```

Optional:

```env
NVIDIA_KEY=...
```

Notes:
- `HACKCLUB_PROXY_API_KEY` is required for the assistant and embedding generation.
- `NVIDIA_KEY` is required only for the Stable Diffusion image generation branch.

### 4. Run Locally

```bash
pnpm dev
```

App runs at `http://localhost:3000`.

## Available Scripts

- `pnpm dev` - Run development server
- `pnpm build` - Production build
- `pnpm start` - Start production server
- `pnpm lint` - Run ESLint

## API Overview

### `POST /api/join`

Stores join requests in Supabase `join_requests`.

Required fields:
- `name`
- `email`
- `message`

Optional fields:
- `school`
- `experience`
- `interests` (array, stored as comma-separated text)

## Database Expectations (Supabase)

At minimum, the code currently assumes tables like:

- `join_requests`
- `contacts`
- `sponsor_leads`

See `TECHNICAL_DOCUMENTATION.md` for deeper schema and function examples.

## Deployment

Configured for Vercel via `vercel.json`.

- Install command: `pnpm install`
- Build command: `pnpm run build`
- Framework: `nextjs`

The app also injects git metadata at build time in `next.config.mjs`.

## Operational Notes

- `next.config.mjs` currently has `typescript.ignoreBuildErrors: true`.
	- This avoids type-check build blocking, but can hide production issues.
- Rate limiting in `lib/rate-limit.ts` is in-memory.
	- For multi-instance consistency, move to Redis or a shared store.
